    o	The combination of a function, and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. 
    o	When a function is declared, a new scope is created, we call that "functional" scope. 
    o	The variables or functions dexlared within that function have the ability to reach OUTWARD for context, but NEVER INWARD. 
    o	This paradigm remains true, no matter how deep you nest functions. i. e., the deepest nested fuction can reach all the way to the outer function.
