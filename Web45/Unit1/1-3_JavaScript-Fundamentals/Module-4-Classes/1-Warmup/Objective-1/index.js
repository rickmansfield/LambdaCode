// For this challenge, we want you to build out a few classes based on your ancestral tree. (If you're not sure about any of your family's information go ahead and make up names like "Grandpa" and "Grandma").

// Go back a few generations and create a Grandpa or Grandma class. Name either one for your parent's parents.

// Create a Parent class named for one of your parents. Parent inherits from Grandpa/Grandma.

// Create a Child class (you) who inherits from Parent.

// Be sure to log out any methods that you use for this project. Any features (i.e. eye color, hair color) that you'd inherit from your ancestors, be sure to include as attributes and pass them down the class chain. Every class should at least be instantiated with the following attributes. name, birthPlace, eyeColor, hairColor.
