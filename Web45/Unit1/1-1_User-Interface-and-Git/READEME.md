Having the ability to craft user interface is key for full stack web developers in all organizations. Another key ability for professional developers is knowing how to use git. This week we will cover those skills and more, and work to create several fully functional websites, including a multi-page portfolio site to showcase your work at Lambda.

The goal of this sprint is to build user interfaces and introduce git into our work flow. Concepts covered: Semantic HTML, display types, basic terminal use, basic git use, CSS specificity, and flex box.

User Interface
Even the most complex web applications start with simple HTML elements. Knowing how to use HTML and style it with CSS has a massive impact for your future as a developer. This module will explore the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

Git for Web Development
Git is a distributed version control system. What does that mean to a new web developer? It means that git is used to monitor and control code changes made during development across several people or teams.

Git can be overwhelming at first, but if we break it down concept by concept, it should start to become clear why almost everyone in the industry uses it every day.

Intro CSS
In this module we will dive deeper into the world of CSS to learn about the box model, specificity, and responsive units. These tools will help you to write professional-quality CSS that will be mostly compatible across browser types and screen sizes.

CSS Layouts
Basic HTML and CSS are fundamental to any web site or web app on the internet. Being able to create layouts using CSS is the next progression on your journey to a full stack web developer. In this module we will cover flexbox and continue to work with specificity. There are many ways to layout a page in CSS but flexbox is one of the most powerful and simple ways to do it. We will discuss the basics of what flexbox is and how we use it properly to build a user interface.
