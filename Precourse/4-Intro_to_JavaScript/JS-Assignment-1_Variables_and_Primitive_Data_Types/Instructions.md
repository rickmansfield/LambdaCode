# JS Assignment 1: Variables and Primitive Data Types

In the window next to this you will see some code written out. Please follow the instructions and create the proper variables assigned to the correct primitive data types. 

Note: Variable names do not have quotes around them, so where it asks you to create 'variableName', there should be no quotes in the actual variable name. 

Once you have completed the exercises, click the 'run tests' button up top, this will run the tests. If you have passed all the tests, click submit and move on to the next lesson!
